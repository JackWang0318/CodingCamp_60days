## 环形链表
- 快慢指针法 + 数学推导
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
            # If there is a cycle, the slow and fast pointers will eventually meet
            if slow == fast:
                # Move one of the pointers back to the start of the list
                slow = head
                while slow != fast:
                    slow = slow.next
                    fast = fast.next
                return slow
        # If there is no cycle, return None
        return None
```
